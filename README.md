# python-onlineshop-app
Hi, this is a Python program that is built with the concept of object-orientation. It is like an online store. It is better to have Python 3.10 installed. It is better for your operating system to be Linux. Preferably, Ubuntu, because the cartoon is easier. If you get an error:
ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install notify-osd


debian:
apt-get install
libnotify-bin


Other OS:
Find and install libnotify for your OS.

Windows version

os.system ('notify-send -i "/ home / parham / Documents / 01-programming / projects / Python papillo / icn / inf2.png" "You logined !!!!" "Thanks you"')

Please just change the address of the photo according to where the files are located
